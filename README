YAAS (Yet Another Activation System)
====================================

This system intends to be a minimalist, easy-to [install, manage, use], standards based alternative to OLPC activation web interface. Creating a safe environment for generating XO activations (leases and development keys) for local deployments.

Assumptions
-----------
You should be using bios-crypto for your activations generation.

Packages
--------
The system is composed of 2 packages:

* yaas-server provides the activation generation service. It must run on the same machine where the bios-crypto packages are installed.
* yaas-web provides a web application that acts as a proxy between users and all the activation generation processes.

Both packages are written in Ruby. Fedora Linux is the target platform; the installation documentation and packages are specifically targetted at Fedora. The software should also work fine on other distributions, but with non-Fedora setups you will be on your own in terms of installation, configuration and support.

The software is developed against Ruby 1.9.3. yaas-web is developed against Rails 3.2. It is intended for use on Fedora 18.

Contribute
----------
There are so many things to improve!
