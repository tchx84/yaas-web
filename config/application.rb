# We do not use the bundler/Gemfile system as we target Fedora systems only,
# expecting that yaas-web and its dependencies were installed through yum.
#
# Under the default Rails "Bundler" system, a Gemfile is used to specify the
# dependencies of the application. On first run, a Gemfile.lock file is created
# which "locks" the application onto a set of specific versions of a gem. For
# example, it may lock the application to rake-1.9.2.
#
# Later on, when rake is updated to v1.9.2.2 by yum, inventario will stop
# working as it can no longer find rake-1.9.2. This is not what we want.
#
# The most appropriate solution to this problem appears to be avoiding use
# of Bundler, hence not having any Gemfile or any Gemfile.lock nonsense.
# Instead, just require the dependencies we need, without any strict
# version checking. Assume that yum/RPM did the work to put the right packages
# in place.
#
# The dependencies must be required at this point so that Railtie initializers
# take effect. Loading them later (e.g. in config/initializers) is too late.
#
# For more background, see
